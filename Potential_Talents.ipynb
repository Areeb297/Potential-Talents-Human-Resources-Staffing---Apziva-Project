    "### **Project Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "A talent sourcing and management company requires automating the process of identifying and ranking the best candidates for various roles where the current manual process is challenging and labor-intensive. The key challenges the company faces are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Understanding the role: Accurately interpreting client's needs and expectations for potential candidates\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Evaluating Candidates: Determining what makes a candidate suitable for a given role.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Sourcing talent: Finding qualified individuals from a large pool of candidates from a given list given to HR.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address, the aim of this project is to develop a ML-powered pipeline that automates candidate ranking based on their \"fitness\" for a specific role. Additionally, this system should adaptively re-rank candidates based on the human reviewer initial seletion such that the model re-ranks the list to better align with the reviewer's preferences, considering the starred candidate as the most important for this particular role. This will imporove the rankings generated by system over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Key Requirements:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Fitness prediction\n",
    "* Ranking\n",
    "* Re-ranking\n",
    "* Mitigate Human Bias in the process\n",
    "* Filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Data Description:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains anonymized candidate information sourced through the company's semi-automated process and sourcing efforts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. id: Unique numeric identifier for each candidate\n",
    "2. job_title: Text description of the candidate's job title.\n",
    "3. location: Geographical location of the candidate.\n",
    "4. connections: Number of professional connections the candidate has (e.g., 500+ indicates more than 500 connections).\n",
    "5. fit: Target variable indicating the candidate's fitness score (numeric probability between 0 and 1). We can use cosine-similarity for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, the fit column is empty so we need to employ NLP techniques such as TF-IDF, Word2Vec, Bert, Open source LLMs etc to match our search with job_title, location, and connections (the more the connections, the better it is as it is considered an added benefit).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Keywords:**\n",
    "The data is based on searching specifc keywords for roles:\n",
    "1. Aspiring human resources\n",
    "2. Seeking human resources\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Goals & Objective:**\n",
    "1. Build a predictive model to calculate fitness score for each candidate based on given query.\n",
    "2. Use fitness scores to rank candidates for specific roles.\n",
    "3. Enable re-ranking based on manual feedback (starring action).\n",
    "4. Identify methods to filter out candidates which in the first place should not be in this list?\n",
    "5. Define an adaptive cut-off point that would work for other roles to exclude low-potential candidates while retaining high-potential ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective is to develop an intelligent candidate ranking system to ensure best and most talented candidates are selected to technology companies using NLP techniques such as TF-IDF, Cosine Similarity, Word2Vec, Transformer-Based Models and leveraging open source LLMs with frameworks like LangChain to automate aspects of candidate evaluation process.\n"

It was developed by a team at Google in 2013, we can use it to better understand semantic relationships between words.\n",

    "\n",
    "When it comees to **CBOW, it predicts a word based on the words around it. This is fast**, and works well for common words. The context is defined a pre-defined window size which determines how many words before and after the target word are considered. The average vector that is calculated is passed through a small neural network where the word with the highest probability is predicted as the target word. CBOW does not care about the word order, it learns word relationships by adjusting the word vectors during training so that the average vector matches the target word.\n",

    "Concerning <u>**Skip-Gram, the idea is to predict context words from the target, it essentially works the other way around.** For each target word, the model uses it to predict the context words within the same window size, this method is **slow but more precise**</u> as it is useful for learning high quality word vectors for rare words. **Skip-Gram uses negative sampling** which updates only a small number of weights instead of all vocabulary words, it picks a few negative words and ensures the model assigns low probabilities to them.\n",

    "**Learning to Rank (LTR) is a ML approac**h utilizing NLP to train models simply for ranking systems based on their relevance to a query, although some methods rank items independently of the query, relying on intrinsic features like text length or item ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other approaches take query-specific features, such as how frequently a query term appears in a document. These approaches allow system to adapt to diverse ranking context based on user requirements, whether general or query-dependent.\n",
    "\n",
    "When training an LTR model, we have 3 core methodologies used:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1.   **Pointwise Methods:** Treat as a standard ML task by predicting relevance score for each item independently, evaluating them row by row.\n",
    "2.   **Pairwise Methods:** Focus on predicting relative order between pairs of items where we are simultaneously comparing two items at a time & deciding which one should be ranked first. The system learns how to compare to create a full, ranked list that's accurate & consistent.\n",
    "3.   **Listwise Methods:** This approach optimizes the ranking of an entire list by directly aligning the list with user-defined ranking standards. Simply put, listwise methods take an entire list of items and learns how to sort them in the best order based on examples of already sorted lists.\n",

    "LTR Models involve measuring effectiveness in producing accurate rankings. Common evaluation metrics include:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Mean Average Precision (MAP): Calculates precision of model's top-ranked items & evaluates binary relevance judgements based on the training set.\n",
    "\n",

    "\\text{Precision} = \\frac{\\text{Number of Relevant Documents Retrieved}}{\\text{Number of Total Documents Retrieved}}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",

    "Basically, the above measures how many items returned by the system are actually relevant, providing insight into the system's ability to filter out irrelevant information. Basically for each query, the system calculates the average precision considering precision at various cutoff points (relevant documents received) & then provides a single-figure measure of quality across a set of queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Discounted Cumulative Gain (DCG):\n",
    "\n",
    "In this algorithm, we simply start off with a ranked list of items by the model. Each item gets assigned a relevance score based on how useful it is. Then we reduce the impact of lower-ranked items through applying discount factor:\n",

This process can be resource-intensive, but several techniques have been developed to make it more efficient. There have been several approaches to fine-tuning namely: Full Fine-tuning, Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning, Instruction Fine-Tuning, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback & more.\n",

    "1. **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation):**\n",

    "  This technique fine-tunes LLMs by introducing low-rank trainable weights and only modifies a small subset of the model's parameters. Essentially, it adds small 'adapter' matrices to the existing weights rather than changing all weights, which dramatically reduces memory requirements and training time.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Instead of directly updating a weight matrix of the attention layer (W), LoRA introduces trainable matrices B & A. B has shape (d x r) and A has shape (r x k), where d and k are the dimensions of the original weight matrix. Note: LoRA is typically applied to attention layers in transformer models as they typically have a large number of parameters, crucial for context understanding, and core of transformer models overall.\n",
    "\n",
    "  r is the rank, which is smaller than d and k. The updated weight matrix during fine-tuning is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "  W + ΔW = W + BA where ΔW = BA is the low-rank approximation of the changes to the weight matrix. By choosing a small rank r, we can significantly reduce the number of trainable parameters. The total number of parameters in BA is r x (d + k) which is much smaller than d x k when r is small.\n",

    "  QLoRA builds upon LoRA by adding quantization (reducing the precision of floating-point numbers used in the model) to further reduce memory requirements typically using 4-bit or 8-bit integers, instead of the usual 16-bit or 32-bit floating-point numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "  The pre-trained model's weights are quantized to a lower precision and with this quantization such as 4-bit quantization, double quantization, paged optimizers & more, it allows large models to be run on mobile phones, IoT devices & other edge devices with limited memory & processing power.\n",

    "3. **PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning):**\n",
    "\n",
    "  PEFT is a general approach to fine-tuning large language models that includes techniques like LoRA and QLoRA. The approach aims to minimize the number of trainable parameters by freezing the majority of the model's parameters and introducing new, smaller sets of parameters that are specifically tuned for the task at hand. For instance, in the case of Adapter Layers, small neural network modules are inserted between layers of the original model. Only these adapter layers are trained, leaving the original model weights untouched.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Major PEFT Mehods can be categorized into the following:\n",
    "  1. Adapter Methods: Adding small, trainable modules to the model.\n",
    "  2. Low-Rank Methods: Using low-rank matrix decompositions to reduce trainable parameters e.g., LoRA, Intrinsic SAID.\n",
    "  3. Prompt Tuning: Modifying input embeddings with trainable prompts e.g., P-tuning (create a set of trainable embeddings (vectors) that act as prompts, we prepend these trainable embeddings to the input & feed the combined input to the model to generate the desired output.\n",
    "  4. Selective Methods: Fine-tuning only a subset of existing parameters e.g., Top Layer Fine-Tuning, Specific Parameter Fine-Tuning, Sparse Updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Instruction Fine-Tuning:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Instruction fine‑tuning is a supervised training approach where pre‑trained language models are further trained on curated datasets of instruction–response pairs to improve their ability to follow human directives across a wide range of tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) involves training a reward model on human preference data and then using reinforcement learning algorithms to optimize the model’s outputs so they better align with those preferences\n",
