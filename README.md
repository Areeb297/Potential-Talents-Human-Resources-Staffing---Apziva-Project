Intelligent Candidate Ranking System
Project Summary
A talent sourcing and management company requires an automated solution to identify and rank the best candidates for various roles. The current manual process is challenging and labor-intensive. The key challenges include:

Understanding the Role: Accurately interpreting client needs and expectations for potential candidates.
Evaluating Candidates: Determining what makes a candidate suitable for a given role.
Sourcing Talent: Finding qualified individuals from a large pool of candidates.
This project aims to develop an ML-powered pipeline that automates candidate ranking based on their "fitness" for a specific role. The system is designed to adaptively re-rank candidates based on human reviewer input (e.g., when candidates are "starred") so that the list better aligns with the reviewer’s preferences over time. This re-ranking process will continuously improve the quality of the generated candidate lists.

Key Requirements
Fitness Prediction: Build a predictive model to calculate a fitness score for each candidate.
Ranking: Use the fitness score to generate an initial ranking of candidates.
Re-ranking: Adapt the ranking based on manual feedback (starring) to reflect the reviewer's preferences.
Mitigate Human Bias: Integrate methods to reduce the impact of bias in the candidate evaluation process.
Filtering: Identify and filter out candidates who should not be considered for a given role.
Adaptive Cut-off: Define an adaptive threshold to exclude low-potential candidates while retaining high-potential ones.
Data Description
The dataset contains anonymized candidate information sourced through the company’s semi-automated process and sourcing efforts. The main attributes include:

id: Unique numeric identifier for each candidate.
job_title: Text description of the candidate's job title.
location: Geographical location of the candidate.
connections: Number of professional connections the candidate has (e.g., "500+" indicates more than 500 connections).
fit: A target variable indicating the candidate's fitness score (a numeric probability between 0 and 1). Currently, this field is empty. NLP techniques such as TF-IDF, Word2Vec, BERT, or other open-source LLMs will be employed to compute cosine similarity scores based on job_title, location, and connections (with a higher number of connections being advantageous).

Learning to Rank Techniques
This project leverages advanced learning-to-rank methods to generate and improve candidate rankings:

RankNet
Overview:
RankNet uses pairwise comparisons to train a model that learns to order candidates based on their relevance to a given role. It computes the probability that one candidate should be ranked higher than another by comparing their fitness scores.
Training:
The model is typically trained using a binary cross-entropy loss on pairs of candidate embeddings. The output scores can be high in magnitude, and the model learns to distinguish between more or less suitable candidates through these pairwise comparisons.
LambdaRank
Overview:
LambdaRank builds upon RankNet by incorporating the changes in ranking metrics (e.g., NDCG) directly into the training process. Instead of only focusing on pairwise ordering, LambdaRank scales the gradient updates based on how much swapping two candidates would affect the overall ranking metric.
Training:
The LambdaRank loss uses a surrogate loss function that includes a “lambda” term, which is weighted by the expected change in the ranking metric. This can result in more fine-tuned ranking adjustments that are more closely aligned with end-goal metrics.
Goals & Objectives
Build a Predictive Model:
Develop a model to calculate a fitness score for each candidate based on the given query and candidate attributes.

Rank Candidates:
Use the fitness scores to rank candidates for specific roles.

Enable Re-ranking:
Allow the system to re-rank candidates based on manual feedback (e.g., starring), with starred candidates receiving higher priority.

Filtering:
Identify and filter out candidates who should not be part of the list based on initial screening.

Adaptive Cut-off:
Define an adaptive threshold to exclude low-potential candidates while retaining high-potential ones.

Mitigate Human Bias:
Incorporate strategies to minimize human bias in the candidate selection process.

Leverage NLP Techniques:
Employ various NLP approaches (e.g., TF-IDF, Word2Vec, Transformer-based models, open-source LLMs) to accurately match search queries with candidate attributes such as job_title, location, and connections.

Project Architecture
Data Ingestion & Preprocessing:
Ingest the candidate data, clean and preprocess text fields, and extract necessary features.

Text Embedding:
Use BERT or other NLP models to convert candidate job titles and other text attributes into embeddings.

Fitness Score Calculation:
Compute a fitness score for each candidate using cosine similarity and other NLP techniques.

Initial Ranking:
Generate an initial ranking of candidates based on their computed fitness scores.

Learning to Rank Models:

Train a RankNet model using pairwise comparisons.
Train a LambdaRank model that incorporates ranking metric changes into its loss function.
Re-ranking Based on Feedback:
Allow human reviewers to star candidates, and use these starred candidates to further train the ranking model for better alignment with reviewer preferences.

Evaluation & Filtering:
Evaluate the ranking performance using metrics like NDCG or MRR and apply filters to remove low-potential candidates.

Adaptive Cut-off Definition:
Establish an adaptive cut-off threshold for candidate selection that can generalize to different roles.

Conclusion
The goal of this project is to develop an intelligent, adaptive candidate ranking system that leverages cutting-edge NLP and learning-to-rank methodologies. By integrating both RankNet and LambdaRank, the system not only generates an initial ranking based on fitness scores but also continuously improves its performance through human feedback. This adaptive approach ensures that the best and most qualified candidates are selected, ultimately streamlining the talent sourcing and management process.
